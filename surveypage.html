    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>The study found that many people especially this generation people are mostly like  to 
        eat  modern food  (60%), spicy food (78%), and Non-Vegetarian food (60%). The determinates of food choices/like; 
        such as – good taste, healthful food, good nutrition, hygienic, low cost, good quality and convenience food found 
        very important for choose/like a food.
    </p>
    <p>  The Indian life style has changed tremendously since independence. 
        Food and taste has followed the same trend of change. As food is an important part of one’s life style. 
        It is said some people eat to live and some people live to eat. Industrialization of food industry has 
        changed our plate; earlier fresh food constituted most of our meal, whereas now it has been replaced with 
        processed food.  Food choices  among the people vary from their culture,  family background, society  and 
        living  standard. Eating behavior of people have been found to be affected by several different factors 
        such as availability of time, discipline, self control, society, price, budget limit, option  available  
        etc.  It has been observed that many people prefer to  eat  fast-food  mostly.  These  constraints  may  
        have  affected  the  outcomes  Nagla  (2007) concluded that the consumption pattern is changing in Indian 
        household; green leafy vegetables are least preferred may be due the length of time consumed during the 
        preparation process, viz. cleaning, washing, chopping, and finally, the cooking. In addition to this, 
        method of preparation and cooking has become more and more advance with the use of ultra modern equipments 
        and fuels. 
    </p> 
    <p>Study investigated  the variable  affecting fast  food performance  of customers in India. 
        The study revealed that the key elements laying the impact on the consumers food choice were passion for 
        dining out, socialize, ambience and the taste in urban India. The study found that the people preferences 
        for food are positively associated with their gender and profiles. She revealed that among these, males 
        consider cost, taste and quality  while  choosing  food  over  quality  and  nutritional  value.  However,  
        in  case  of  whites showed different preference than others, location of food outlet and nutritional value 
        of food were found to affected by gender.

    <h3>ANALYSIS OF PAST AND PRESENT INDIA</h3>


    <p>In 1961 the average Indian had a daily calorie intake of 2,010. Their daily diet consisted of 43% grains (378g), 
        23% produce (199g), 12% dairy & eggs (108g), 12% sugar and fat (108g), 2% meat (17g) and 8% as other (68g).
    </p>
    <p>In 2011 the average Indian had a daily calories intake of 2,458. Their daily diet consisted of 34% produce (450g), 
        32% grains (416g), 18% eggs and dairy (235g), 10% sugar and fat (129g), 2% meat (29g) and 4% as other (58g).

    <p>Majority of people were introduced to fast foods through television commercials 193(64.3%). 73(57%) developed 
        this habit as they were bored with home food. Awareness of harmful effects of fast food consumption was known to 
        186(62%) students and this was found to be associated with the perceived need to control its usage (p&lt0.001). 
        Parental consumption of fast foods was found to influence fast food consumption among children (p=0.024). As 
        many as 68(22.7%) and 206(68.7%) children were not eating vegetables and fruits respectively every day. 
        Increased frequency of fast food consumption in a week was found to be associated with overweight or obesity 
        among children after adjusting the effects of confounders (p=0.003).

    <p>cereals and more bread, fewer potatoes and more meats, fewer bidis and more cigarettes, less country liquor 
        and more beer — food habits in India are sharply circumscribed by class, new data shows. The newly released 
        558th round of the National Sample Survey Office, India’s official source of consumption, employment and others 
        statistics, shines a light on India’s consumption habits as of 2011-12. An analysis of data on food and non-food 
        consumption by income group reveals how much of an effect class has on what Indians eat. The top 5 per cent of 
        urban India spends Rs. 3,000 per capita per month on groceries and eating out on average. This class spends nearly 
        Rs. 800 per head per month on eating out (“served processed food”) and another Rs. 206 per person per month on chips, 
        chocolates and other packaged processed foods. At the other end of the spectrum, the bottom 5 per cent of India spends 
        just over Rs. 400 per person per month on food, over a quarter of this on cereals alone. “On the whole, there is a 
        general decline in the consumption of cereals but this is in line with ongoing, expected trends,”. “The share of 
        the household budget that goes towards food is also declining, as expected,”. “As countries get richer and as 
        individuals have more money and are in less strenuous activities, consumption of carbohydrates goes down, and the 
        intake of fruits and vegetables as well as foods with other micronutrients including milk products and meat rises,”
    </p>

    <p>In urban India, where the richest 5 per cent consume the fewest cereals and the most derivatives of cereals like bread and 
        noodles. However in rural India, the richest 5 per cent still consume the most cereals.
    </p>
    <p>
        At higher ends of the income distribution, the consumption of milk, eggs, meat and processed foods rises. On average, 
        fish is India’s most popular non-vegetarian product; the average Indian household consumes 1.14 kg of fish in a month.

    <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

    <p>As for the conclusion of this blog, the traditional Indian food culture should not be forgotten by every generation as 
        it shows the identity of the Indian people itself in terms of culture and norms. Each of the instruments has its own tales 
        and sentimental values along with it. Without them, the indian food will not have its own distinctiveness and cannot 
        achieve the accomplishment that can be seen nowadays.<br>
        Thus, several commendations should be made in supporting the cultures in order to preserve it for longer period:
        <ul>
            <li>Implements the used of traditional Indian food culture as one of the tools in teaching subject related to indian cuisine in primary school so that the children will get the early expose of the cuisine.</li>
            <li>Organize lots of events that encourage the used of Indian food culture and provide incentives for those who involved. Governments and private sectors should join these activities so that it will become more attention-grabbing.</li>
            <li>Government divisions should provide a place in each state that exclusively for the purpose of training younger generations about the beauty of Indian food culture.</li>
        </ul>
        With this rich information of this blog, I hope that readers will gain knowledge and benefits about the Indian food culture. I also hope that the younger generations will continue the tradition and practice so that it will not be elapsed by time. This is one of the things that made indian cultures are differs from others  and put it on top of the list as one of the races that have diverse ethnicity and customary values in it.
